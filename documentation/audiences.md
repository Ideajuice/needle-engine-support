# Getting Up To Speed

Needle Engine is of interest to a number of different audiences. Here is how each of them can get the most out of Needle Tools.

## Unity Developers

Unity developers are already familiar with using Unity components and wiring scene graphs together using the Unity editor. 
Needle Engine allows them to export their Unity scenes to web browser based scenes using the Needle runtime to implement many Unity game engine features.

Unity developers will benefit from learning about the core web technologies used by the runtime engine such as Typescript and three.js. To work with Needle tiny networking, they will benefit from learning about nodel.js.

An excellent resource to learn the above skills is Bruno Simon's excellent [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com)

## Web Developers

Web developers are already familiar with using Typescript and three.js to implement 3D scenes that run in a web browser.

Needle Engine allows them to create Unity wrappers for their typescript code so that it is able to be treated as Unity components in the Unity editor. 

Web developers will benefit from learning the basics of using the unity editor, but need not concern themselves with learning much about unity scripting with C#.

## Blender Artists

Blender artists are familiar with how to use Blender to create 3D scenes for export to the web. Needle Tools for Blender adds new components to the Blender UI that allow Blender scenes to be exported directly to a Needle engine based scene that runs in any modern web browser. 

The new components allow dynamic behaviours to be added to the scene.
