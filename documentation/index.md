  **Needle Engine** is a web client based runtime for 3D apps. It can be deployed to any modern web browser. It is flexible, extensible and has built-in support for collaboration and XR via the Needle Tiny Server! It uses three.js and Typescript to implement a run time game engine in your browser that goes a long way toward implementing most of the functionality of the Unity runtime engine.

**Needle Tools for Unity** bridges the Unity Editor and the Needle Engine. It helps you to export your Unity based assets, animations, lightmaps and 3D scene graph to the web and it helps you bring your TypeScript and three.js based code into Unity. Your TypeScript code can be triggered by Unity events and configured in the Unity inspector like built in Unity components.
It features a world class gLTF exporter built around the glTF standard for 3D assets and uses the gLTF extension mechanism to store the properties you see in the unity inspector so they can be used at runtime by the Needle Engine.  

**Needle Tiny Server** is a tiny node.js based server that implements many common networking features such as VOIP, webcam streaming, RPC messaging, room management, remote storage and network screen sharing. 
You can use Needle Tools and the Needle Engine without a Needle Tiny Server, but for making networked experiences you will need a networking solution and Needle Tiny Server was designed to be a minimal and lightweight solution. Deploy a Needle Tiny Server directly to services like Glitch.io from the unity inspector or create your own custom deploy script to use whatever service you like.

**Together**, they enable incredible iteration speeds and help you to bring your content to the web.  
Some have called us the "Missing Link" between artist-friendly workflows and modern web development!
